# Data Structures Homework Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Homework Repository! This repository serves as a platform for students to submit their homework assignments and for instructors to evaluate them. The website facilitates the submission of assignments and provides test cases to verify the correctness of the solutions.

## About

This project was created collaboratively by Armin Sabourmoghaddam, Amir Khaki, and Ali Farrokh. It aims to streamline the process of collecting and evaluating homework assignments for students studying data structures.

- **[Armin Sabourmoghaddam](https://github.com/Arminsbss)** Developed the full structure of the website using HTML.
- ** [Ali Farrokh](https://github.com/aliifarokh)** Added and designed the UI and UX elements to enhance the user experience.
- **[Amir Khaki](https://github.com/amirkhaki)** Implemented the feature for uploading homework assignments.

## Projects

### 1. Big Number

This project focuses on implementing operations with large numbers, which are beyond the range of standard data types like integers or floats. Students are required to implement arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for big numbers.

### 2. Infix to Postfix

In this project, students are tasked with converting mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation. This requires understanding the rules of operator precedence and using stacks to manage the conversion process.

### 3. Determinant of Matrix

The third project involves calculating the determinant of a matrix using three different methods: rezaeifar, laplacian, and Gaussian elimination. Students need to implement these methods and compare their efficiency and accuracy.

## How to Use

1. **Submitting Homework:** Students can upload their homework assignments for each project through the website. They should ensure that their solutions adhere to the provided requirements and guidelines.

2. **Test Cases:** Test cases are available for each project to help students validate the correctness of their implementations. Instructors can use these test cases to assess the quality of the submitted solutions.

3. **Evaluation:** Instructors can review the submitted assignments, run the test cases against the solutions, and provide feedback to the students. They can also use the test results to assign grades.
